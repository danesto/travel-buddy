My file structure is following
UI components (from shadcn and dumb) are inside src/lib/components/ui. other more logically heavy and app related are under src/lib/components/
Assets are located under src/lib/assets
files and folders shuold use kebab-case always

Use separation of logic, develop shared components when they are needed. I like to run queries on server and use that data on frontend.
I use shadcn components, I write clean well readen code. Code is broken down by what it does.
Pages are consistent from the components and customly added elements, don't over create components when not needed

Have db schema in mind when writing code, so you know how it should work.
